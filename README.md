- Once clicked, the card will reveal it's design
- You have to then click another card to match it's design
- If the two cards you click don't match they'll go back to being hidden so you have to remember which card had what design and where it was located
- Once you click your first card a timer will start
- Every 2 cards you click will count as a move, if you take too many moves your star rating will go down
